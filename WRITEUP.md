The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

The inference time of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

1. Automate Carp Counting
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Each of these use cases would be useful because...
1. Automate Carp Counting - 
2.

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: ssd_inception_v2_coco
  - [http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
   ```
  python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json
  ```
- Model 2: faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco
  - [http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
 ```
    python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model model/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco/frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/faster_rcnn_support.json
 ```
- Model 3: ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco
  - [http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
  ```
  python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo_tf.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json --reverse_input_channel
  ```
- Model 4: person-detection-retail-0013
[person-detection-retail-0013](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html)

Use this commad to dowload the model 

```
python3  /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/tools/model_downloader/downloader.py --name person-detection-retail-0013 -o /home/workspace/model/pre_trained/intel
```

Run the app 
```
python main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m models/intel/person-detection-retail-0013/FP16/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```
## Result  
After run inference on above models, the suitable accurate model was the one provided by IntelÂ® [person-detection-retail-0013](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html) with the already existing in Intermediate Representations.
